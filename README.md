# !bangs-Search-iOS

Inspired by Theo and [https://unduck.link](https://unduck.link), I’ve built an iOS app that brings the same functionality to your device.

## How it works

The iOS app includes a static file containing all the bangs. When you perform a search, the app intercepts your query just as you hit send. It uses the bang lookup to determine where to redirect your search — all without generating any additional network traffic.

## Extension permissions

The extension needs permission to access the URL of the search engine you use on iOS (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo).

## Installation

1. Download the Xcode project.  
2. Install the extension via Settings.  
3. Grant web permissions.  
4. Done!
